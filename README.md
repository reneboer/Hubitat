# Hubitat

Some of my first files for Hubitat

I started with a Qubino ZMNHSD1 DIN Dimmer driver that does not have a temp sensor so it shows properly on Alexa. The device must be included without security or it will cause issues. Use a second controller to do this (zwave stick and SiLabs Windows Zwave Controller software)
